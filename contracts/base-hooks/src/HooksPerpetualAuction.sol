/**
 * @title HooksPerpetualAuction
 * @author Base Protocol Team
 * @notice A perpetual auction system for managing blockchain event hooks with competitive bidding
 * @dev This contract allows users to bid for the right to have their hooks executed when specific 
 *      blockchain events occur. It uses a competitive auction model where higher bidders replace 
 *      lower bidders, with automatic refunds and fee distribution to event originators.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Competitive bidding for hook execution rights on specific contract events
 * - Automatic refund system for outbid participants
 * - Fee sharing with event originators to refund users for their share of MEV
 * - Comprehensive ETH accounting to track reserved funds vs excess revenue
 * - Owner-controlled excess ETH withdrawal for contract maintenance
 * - Gas-limited hook execution to prevent DoS attacks
 * - Deposit management system allowing hook owners to extend their auction duration
