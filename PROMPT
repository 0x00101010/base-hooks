I want to spin up a op stack devnet with flashblocks capability, the features include:

1. it's a op stack devnet, it looks like https://github.com/flashbots/builder-playground is the best repo to start it
2. I want to have flashblocks capability enabled, which means we'll need a op-rbuilder, refer to https://github.com/flashbots/op-rbuilder for starting it
3. After deploy, I want to deploy uniswap v3 & USDC contracts to the devnet, so that I can setup a simple LP pool for it

Help me generate an automated script to
1. clean up before each run
2. start the devnet in the background and deploy the contracts 
3. output some private keys with funds so that I can use to interact with pool
